## üìÇ Contents

* **\[TEST QN 1.cpp]\(d:\C++ for Mechanical Engineering\TEST QN 1.cpp)**
  Finds the largest element in an integer array using the **\[ArrayProcessor]\(d:\C++ for Mechanical Engineering\TEST QN 1.cpp#L6)** class.

* **\[TEST QN 2.cpp]\(d:\C++ for Mechanical Engineering\TEST QN 2.cpp)**
  Displays a full name multiple times using the **\[Name]\(d:\C++ for Mechanical Engineering\TEST QN 2.cpp#L5)** class.

* **\[TEST QN 3.cpp]\(d:\C++ for Mechanical Engineering\TEST QN 3.cpp)**
  Calculates the area of a circle or the volume of a cylinder using the **\[ShapeCalculator]\(d:\C++ for Mechanical Engineering\TEST QN 3.cpp#L5)** class.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Open any `.cpp` file in your C++ IDE (e.g., **Visual Studio Code**, **Code::Blocks**, or **CLion**).
2. Compile the file:

   ```bash
   g++ TEST\ QN\ 1.cpp -o test1
   ```

   (Replace the filename as needed.)
3. Run the executable:

   ```bash
   ./test1
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

* **C++11** or newer
* A standard C++ compiler (**g++**, **clang**, or **MSVC**)
