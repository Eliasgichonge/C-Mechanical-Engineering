C++ for Mechanical Engineering
This folder contains C++ programs for basic computational tasks, suitable for mechanical engineering students. Each file demonstrates a different concept using classes and standard C++ libraries.

Contents
[TEST QN 1.cpp](d:\C++ for Mechanical Engineering\TEST QN 1.cpp): Finds the largest element in an integer array using the [ArrayProcessor](d:\C++ for Mechanical Engineering\TEST QN 1.cpp#L6) class.
[TEST QN 2.cpp](d:\C++ for Mechanical Engineering\TEST QN 2.cpp): Displays a full name multiple times using the [Name](d:\C++ for Mechanical Engineering\TEST QN 2.cpp#L5) class.
[TEST QN 3.cpp](d:\C++ for Mechanical Engineering\TEST QN 3.cpp): Calculates the area of a circle or the volume of a cylinder using the [ShapeCalculator](d:\C++ for Mechanical Engineering\TEST QN 3.cpp#L5) class.
